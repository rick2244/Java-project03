I wasn't sure how you wanted the property file input to be handled. I have my own file in my implementation. Since it was requested that the file by run with only one argument you will have to input your own properties file into my code manually. I'm also a little confused on the the name of the main Implementation file since in the instructions it's called TextAnalyzer, but the java given is called Driver I wanted to use Hashmaps to handle the program, especially the count sections, but Brizan made sure to stress that I base everything of a linked list as instructed so I had to create my own methods to support my LinkedList My scan takes input from the next line, so to end the input just hit enter twice I was also confused about the Property files rule, so I just had it throw an exception if there isn't a property file added instead of having a default avoid words.
